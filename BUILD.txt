Build Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.5.
MSVC 2013 or higher is needed as a compiler.
GIT command line tools are required.
Additionally my atools static library is needed.

- Clone atools GIT repository
- Clone littlenavconnect GIT repository into the same directory

Windows
------------------------------------------------------

- Get and install Qt Creator from http://www.qt.io.
- Import atools and littlenavconnect into the workspace.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
-- For atools use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\atools\release"
-- For littlenavconnect use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\littlenavconnect\release"
- Adapt the QT_BIN, GIT_BIN and SIMCONNECT variables in "littlenavconnect.pro".
- Set the build kit for atools and littlenavconnect to MSVC 2013 (or higher) 32 bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator
- Build and run.

It is important that the shadow build directories reside within the project directories and are
named "release" and "debug" depending on desired build. Do not use the default shadow names, this will
break project dependencies.
