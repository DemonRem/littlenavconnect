Build Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.5.
MSVC 2013 or higher is needed for compilation.
GIT command line tools are required.
Additionally my atools static library is needed.

- Clone atools GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git)
- Clone littlenavconnect GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/littlenavconnect.git) into the same
  directory as atools

Windows
------------------------------------------------------

- Get and install Qt Creator from http://www.qt.io.
- Import atools and littlenavconnect into the workspace.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
-- Clone atools from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\atools"
-- For atools use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-atools-release"
-- Clone littlenavconnect from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\littlenavconnect"
-- For littlenavconnect use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-littlenavconnect-release"
- Adapt the QT_BIN, GIT_BIN and SIMCONNECT variables in "littlenavconnect.pro".
- Set the build kit for atools and littlenavconnect to MSVC 2013 (or higher) 32 bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator
- Build from Qt Creator

Do not use the default shadow build directory names, this will break project dependencies.

Branches / Project Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------

Little Navconnect has to be built using MSVC >= 2013.
Building on Linux is only useful for testing and debugging purposes.

Make sure to use the correct branches to avoid breaking dependencies.
The branch master is the unstable development branch but all software should compile there.

For releases check the release/MAJOR.MINOR branches to get the correct dependencies.
The atools branch is usually one MAJOR number ahead.

So Little Navconnect branch release/1.0 should work well with atools release/2.0 for example.
