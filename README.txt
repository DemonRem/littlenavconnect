pain of setting up remote SimConnect links.

An installer or setup program is not available.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\" since
you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps control on
these folders other problems might occur, like replaced or deleted files.
Extract the Zip archive into a folder, like "c:\Own Programs\Little Navconnect".
Then start the program by double-clicking "littlenavconnect.exe".

Little Navconnect is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows XP 32-bit,
