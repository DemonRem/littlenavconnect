pain of setting up remote SimConnect links.

An installer or setup program is not available.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\" since
you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps control on
these folders other problems might occur, like replaced or deleted files.

Extract the Zip archive into a folder, like "c:\Own Programs\Little Navconnect".

The zip archive contains the files vcredist_x86.exe and vcredist_x64.exe which install
the MSVC 2013 runtime distributables. Runing both installers is recommended. The installation will
be skipped if one of the runtime distributables is already installed.

Start the program by double-clicking "littlenavconnect.exe".

Little Navconnect is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

Little Navconnect does not run in Windows XP.
